     <article><p>This short tutorial is meant for people who want to start using CSS and have never written a CSS style sheet before.</p><p>It does not explain much of CSS. It just explains how to create an HTML file, a CSS file and how to make them work together. After that, you can read any of a number of other tutorials to add more features to the HTML and CSS files. Or you can switch to using a dedicated HTML or CSS editor, that helps you set up complex sites.</p></article>

     <header>The HTML</header>
     <article><p>For this tutorial, I suggest you use only the very simplest of tools. E.g., Notepad (under Windows), TextEdit (on the Mac) or KEdit (under KDE) will do fine. Once you understand the principles, you may want to switch to more advanced tools, or even to commercial programs, such as Style Master, Dreamweaver or GoLive. But for your very first CSS style sheet, it is good not to be distracted by too many advanced features.</p>
<p>Don't use a wordprocessor, such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice. They typically make files that a Web browser cannot read. For HTML and CSS, we want simple, plain text files.</p>
<p>Step 1 is to open your text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, KEdit, or whatever is your favorite), start with an empty window and type the following:</p>
       <code>
          &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"&gt;</br>
          &lt;html&gt;</br>
          &lt;head&gt;</br>
          &lt;title&gt;My first styled page&lt;/title&gt;</br>
          &lt;/head&gt;</br>

          &lt;body&gt;</br>

          &lt;!-- Site navigation menu --&gt;</br>
          &lt;ul class="navbar"&gt;</br>
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home page&lt;/a&gt;</br>
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="musings.html"&gt;Musings&lt;/a&gt;</br>
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="town.html"&gt;My town&lt;/a&gt;</br>
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="links.html"&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt;</br>
          &lt;/ul&gt;</br>

          &lt;!-- Main content --&gt;</br>
          &lt;h1&gt;My first styled page&lt;/h1&gt;</br>

          &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my styled page!&lt;/p&gt;</br>

          &lt;p&gt;It lacks images, but at least it has style.
          And it has links, even if they don't go
          anywhere&lt;/p&gt;</br>

          &lt;p&gt;There should be more here, but I don't know
what yet.&lt;/p&gt;</br>

          &lt;!-- Sign and date the page, it's only polite! --&gt;</br>
          &lt;address&gt;Made 5 April 2004&lt;br&gt;
            by myself.&lt;/address&gt;</br>

          &lt;/body&gt;</br>
          &lt;/html&gt;</br>
</code>
      
       <p>If you want to know what the names in <…> mean, one good place to start is Getting started with HTML. But just a few words about the structure of our example HTML page.</p>

<li>The “ul” is a list with one hyperlink per item. This will serve as our “site navigation menu,” linking to the other pages of our (hypothetical) Web site. Presumably, all pages on our site have a similar menu.</li>
<li>The “h1” and “p” elements form the unique content of this page, while the signature at the bottom (“address”) will again be similar on all pages of the site.</li>

     <header>Adding color</header>
     <article><p>You probably see some black text on a white background, but it depends on how the browser is configured. So one easy thing we can do to make the page more stylish is to add some colors. (Leave the browser open, we will use it again later.)</p>

<p>We will start with a style sheet embedded inside the HTML file. Later, we will put the HTML and the CSS in separate files. Separate files is good, since it makes it easier to use the same style sheet for multiple HTML files: you only have to write the style sheet once. But for this step, we just keep everything in one file.</p>

<p>We need to add a &lt;style&gt; element to the HTML file. The style sheet will be inside that element. So go back to the editor window and add the following five lines in the head part of the HTML file. The lines to add are shown in red.</p>
       <code>
            <strong>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;</br>
            body {</br>
              color: purple;</br>
              background-color: #d8da3d }</br>
            &lt;/style&gt;</strong></br>
        </code>
      <p>The first line says that this is a style sheet and that it is written in CSS (“text/css”). The second line says that we add style to the “body” element. The third line sets the color of the text to purple and the next line sets the background to a sort of greenish yellow.</p>
      <p>Style sheets in CSS are made up of rules. Each rule has three parts:</p>
      <li>the selector (in the example: “body”), which tells the browser which part of the document is affected by the rule;</li>
      <li>the property (in the example, 'color' and 'background-color' are both properties), which specifies what aspect of the layout is being set;</li>
      <li>and the value ('purple' and '#d8da3d'), which gives the value for the style property.</li>
     </article>
   </section>
   <section class="main-section" id="Adding_fonts">
     <header>Adding fonts</header>
     <article>
       <p>Another thing that is easy to do is to make some distinction in the fonts for the various elements of the page. So let's set the text in the “Georgia” font, except for the h1 heading, which we'll give “Helvetica.”
       </p>
       <p>On the Web, you can never be sure what fonts your readers have on their computers, so we add some alternatives as well: if Georgia is not available, Times New Roman or Times are also fine, and if all else fails, the browser may use any other font with serifs. If Helvetica is absent, Geneva, Arial and SunSans-Regular are quite similar in shape, and if none of these work, the browser can choose any other font that is serif-less.
       </p>
       <p>In the text editor add the following lines:</p>
       <code>
          &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;</br>
          body {</br>
            <strong>font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman",
                  Times, serif;</strong></br>
            color: purple;</br>
            background-color: #d8da3d }</br>
          <strong>h1 {</br>
            font-family: Helvetica, Geneva, Arial,</br>
                  SunSans-Regular, sans-serif }</strong></br>
          &lt;/style&gt;</br>
        </code>

     <header>A navigation bar</header>
     <article>
       <p>The list at the top of the HTML page is meant to become a navigation menu. Many Web sites have some sort of menu along the top or on the side of the page and this page should have one as well. We will put it on the left side, because that is a little more interesting than at the top…          </p>
       <p>The menu is already in the HTML page. It is the &lt;ul&gt; list at the top. The links in it don't work, since our “Web site” so far consists of only one page, but that doesn't matter now. On a real Web site, there should not be any broken links, of course.</p>
        <p>So we need to move the list to the left and move the rest of the text a little to the right, to make room for it. The CSS properties we use for that are 'padding-left' (to move the body text) and 'position', 'left' and 'top' (to move the menu).</p>

        <p>There are other ways to do it. If you look for “column” or “layout” on the <cite>Learning CSS</cite> page, you will find several ready-to-runtemplates. But this one is OK for our purposes</p>
         <p>In the editor window, add the following lines to the HTML
          file:
         </p>
          <code>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;</br>
            body {</br><strong>padding-left: 11em;</strong></br>font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman",Times, serif;</br>color: purple;</br>background-color: #d8da3d }</br>
  <strong>ul.navbar {</br>position: absolute;</br>top: 2em;</br>left: 1em;</br>width: 9em }</strong></br>h1 {</br>font-family: Helvetica, Geneva, Arial,SunSans-Regular, sans-serif }</br>&lt;/style&gt;</br></code>

       <p>The navigation menu still looks like a list, instead of a menu. Let's add some style to it. We'll remove the list bullet and move the items to the left, to where the bullet was. We'll also give each item its own white background and a black square. (Why? No particular reason, just because we can.)</p>
       <p>We also haven't said what the colors of the links should be, so let's add that as well: blue for links that the user hasn't seen yet and purple for links already visited:</p>
       <code>
         &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;</br>body {</br>
 ...</br><strong>list-style-type: none;</br>padding: 0;</br>margin: 0;</strong></br>position: absolute;</br>top: 2em;</br>left: 1em;</br>width: 9em }</br>h1 {</br>font-family: Helvetica, Geneva, Arial,SunSans-Regular, sans-serif }</br><strong>ul.navbar li {</br>background: white;</br>margin: 0.5em 0;</br>padding: 0.3em;</br>border-right: 1em solid black }</br>ul.navbar a {</br>text-decoration: none }</br>a:link {</br>color: blue }</br>a:visited {</br>color: purple }</strong></br>&lt;/style&gt;</br>
       </code>

   <section class="main-section" id="Horizontal_line">
     <header>Horizontal line</header>
     <article><p>The final addition to the style sheet is a horizontal rule to separate the text from the signature at the bottom. We will use'border-top' to add a dotted line above the &lt;address&gt; element</p>
       <code>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;</br>body {</br>...</br><strong>address {</br>margin-top: 1em;</br>padding-top: 1em;</br>border-top: thin dotted }</strong></br>&lt;/style&gt;</code></br>

     <article>
       <p>We now have an HTML file with an embedded style sheet. But if our site grows we probably want many pages to share the same style. There is a better method than copying the style sheet into every page: if we put the style sheet in a separate file, all pages can point to it.</p> <p>To make a style sheet file, we need to create another empty text file. You can choose “New” from the File menu in the editor, to create an empty window. (If you are using TextEdit, don't forget to make it plain text again, using the Format menu.)</p><p>Then cut and paste everything that is inside the &lt;style&gt; element from the HTML file into the new window. Don't copy the &lt;style&gt; and &lt;/style&gt; themselves. They belong to HTML, not to CSS. In the new editor window, you should now have the complete style sheet:</p><p>Choose “Save As…” from the File menu, make sure that you are in the same directory/folder as the mypage.html file, and save the style sheet as “mystyle.css”.</p><p>Now go back to the window with the HTML code. Remove everything from the &lt;style&gt; tag up to and including the &lt;/style&gt; tag and replace it with a &lt;link&gt; element.</p><p>This will tell the browser that the style sheet is found in the file called “mystyle.css” and since no directory is mentioned, the browser will look in the same directory where it found the HTML file.</p><p>If you save the HTML file and reload it in the browser, you should see no change: the page is still styled the same way, but now the style comes from an external file.</p>
